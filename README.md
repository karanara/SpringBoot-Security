       Spring Secuirty defines a framework for security which is implemented using servlet filters in the background.
       Two methods for securing an app:
           Declarative and Programmatic
      Spring Security with Servlet Filters::
         Servlet filters are used to pre-process/post-process web requests.
     Security Concepts: Authentication -- check user id and password with credentials stored in app/db
                        Authorization -- check to see if user has an authorized role
    Declarative Security:  define application's security constraints in configuration.All java config --@Configuration
    Programmatic Security: provides an API for custom application coding and greater customization for specific app requirements
  Passwords are stored in specifi format -- noop,bcrypt
  Adding users and passwords and roles:
         1.@Bean ---InMemoryUserDetailsManager [ UserDetails user1=User.builder().username("username1").password("{noop}test123").roles("ROLE1").build();]
         2.Restrict access based on roles -- general Syntax -- requestMatchers(http method,"aadd pathh").hasRole("ROLE1")
                                                              requestMatchers(HttpMethod.GET,"/api/employee").hasRole("EMPLOYEE")
         3.@Bean -- SecurityFilterChain 
Coming to JDBC -- use JdbcUserDetailManager(dataSource)
If we wnat to use usernames and passwords with custom schema and without defualt schema -- setUsersByUsernameQuery and setAuthoritiesByUsernameQuery.
